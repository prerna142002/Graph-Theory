Shortest path problems
----------------------
Given a weighted graphs find the shortest path of edgees from node A to node B.
Algorithms: BFS, Dikstra's, Bellman Ford, A* and many

Connectivity
------------
Does there exist a path between node A and node B/
Typical Solutions: Use union find data structures or any search algorithms.

Negative Cycles
---------------
Does my weighted digraphs have any negative cycles? If so, where?
Algorithms: Bellman-Ford and Floyd-Warshall

Strongly Connected Components:
--------------------------------
Can be thought of as self-contained cycles within a directed graphs where vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertx in the same cycle.
Algorithms: Tarjan's and Kosaraju's Algorithm
