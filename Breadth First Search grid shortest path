Many problmes in graphs theory can be represented using a grid.
Grids are a form of implicit graph because we can determine a node's neighbours based on our location within the grid.

Graph Theory on Grids:
----------------------
A common approach to solving graph theory problems on grids is to first convert the grid to a familiar format such as an adjancency list/matrix.
IMPORTANT: Assume the grid is unweighted and cells left, right, up and down.

Once we have an adjanceny list/matrix we can run whatever specialized graph algo to solve our problem such as:
shortest path, connected components , etc.

However, transformations between graph representataions can usually be avoided due to the structure of a grid.

This makes it easy to access neightbouring cells from the current row-column position.
